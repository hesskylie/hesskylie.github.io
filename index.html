  <h2>about me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a full stack software engineer with endless customer service experience and
    communication skills looking for my next opportunity. I love solving
    puzzles in an efficient way & being able to bounce ideas off of people who
    are smarter than me. I'm looking for great mentors and role models in an
    industry that is new to me for now, so one day I can move from being a
    helpful team member to an inspirational team leader.
  </p>
  <p>I'm an enthusiastic plant mom & dog aunt. I love beach volleyball & being outside in general. My time at Fullstack
    Academy introduced me to & fueled my addiction for idle games. In non-pandemic times, you would find me cheering on
    the Michigan State Spartans in football or basketball, but the stay at home recommendations have given me an excuse
    to deck out in comfy athletic apparel bearing its name more often.</p>

      <h3>Opus</h4>
        <p>
          Opus is an educational virtual piano keyboard I created with three other
          team members in about two and a half weeks for my Fullstack Academy capstone
          project. Users can free play on a virtual piano, play a preset song with
          guided animation, or go on lessons for beginners, complete with exercises
          to test their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for creating the lessons & exercise flow, modifying an
          existing piano keyboard API to do our bidding, and setting up a progress
          system for logged in users.

      <h3>The LAL Store</h4>
        <p>The LAL Store is a fully functional e-commerce site selling books. I created the app with two other team
          members in less than two weeks at Fullstack Academy.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for all admin features and some user experiences. I found creative solutions to problems
          such as compiling average ratings for a book & displaying the ratings as stars.</p>
        <p>Technology used: React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Node.js, Bulma, Faker</p>

      <h3>Is It Cancelled?</h3>
      <p>A comprehensive resource listing events affected by the pandemic. Users can follow events & receive
        notifications about status changes. I am the sole developer. I created relationships between users and events,
        sorted the events into easy to follow categories, and assigned color coded status to the events. The event list
        and statuses were compiled in March 2020.</p>

      <h3>Gallery Editor</h3>
      <p>A work in progress social media site to share photo galleries between users. I'm going to learn how to
        implement drag and drop file uploads, let users order their photos in the galleries, and keep my stack skills
        sharp. I am the sole developer. So far I have set up the app's frameworks and have begun to dig into the
        components of photo upload and displaying galleries.</p>
