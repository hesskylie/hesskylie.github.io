    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a full stack software engineer with endless customer service experience and
      communication skills looking for my next opportunity. I love solving
      puzzles in an efficient way & being able to bounce ideas off of people who
      are smarter than me. I'm looking for great mentors and role models in an
      industry that is new to me for now, so one day I can move from being a
      helpful team member to an inspirational team leader.
    </p>
    <p>I'm an enthusiastic plant mom & dog aunt. I love beach volleyball & being outside in general. My time at Fullstack Academy introduced me to & fueled my addiction for idle games. In non-pandemic times, you would find me cheering on the Michigan State Spartans in football or basketball, but the stay at home recommendations have given me an excuse to deck out in comfy athletic apparel bearing its name more often.</p>

    <h3>Opus</h4>
    <p>
      Opus is an educational virtual piano keyboard I created with three other
      team members in about two and a half weeks for my Fullstack Academy capstone
      project. Users can free play on a virtual piano, play a preset song with
      guided animation, or go on lessons for beginners, complete with exercises
      to test their skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was responsible for creating the lessons & exercise flow, modifying an
      existing piano keyboard API to do our bidding, and setting up a progress
      system for logged in users.

    <h3>The LAL Store</h4>
    <p>The LAL Store is a fully functional e-commerce site selling books. I created the app with two other team members in less than two weeks at Fullstack Academy.</p>
    <p>I was responsible for all admin features and some user experiences. I found creative solutions to problems such as compiling average ratings for a book & displaying the ratings as stars.</p>
    <p>Technology used: React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Node.js, Bulma, Faker</p>

    <h3>Is It Cancelled?</h3>
    <p>A comprehensive resource listing events affected by the pandemic. Users can follow events & receive notifications about status changes. I am the sole developer. I created relationships between users and events, sorted the events into easy to follow categories, and assigned color coded status to the events.</p>
