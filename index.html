    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a full stack software engineer with endless customer service and
      communication skills looking for my next opportunity. I love solving
      puzzles in an efficient way & being able to bounce ideas off of people who
      are smarter than me. I'm looking for great mentors and role models in an
      industry that is new to me for now, so one day I can move from being a
      helpful team member to an inspirational team leader.
